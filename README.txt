- Replace the folders "views" and "public" in your projects with the folders in this zip file.

- "views" contains all the .ejs file written in HTML, "public" contains all the images needed for the project.

- You won't be able to GET or POST the .ejs files until you configure them correctly in the app.js file.

- You will have to get the videos yourself, rename them according to the names in the movies .ejs files, and put them in the "public" folder.
